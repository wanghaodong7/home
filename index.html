		<h2 id="Early_Life"> Early Life </h2>	
		<h3 class="c"> Birth </h3>
		<p>
			Oskar Schindler &lpar;1908&dash;1974&rpar; was born in Zwittau, Moravia, Austria-Hungary April 28, 1908 to the German family of 
				Johann Schindler and Franziska Schindler. His sister Elfriede was born seven years later in 1915.
		</p>   
		<h3 class="c"> Education </h3>
		<p> 
			After graduating High School, Schindler enrolled in a trade school. He was later expelled in 1924 for forging his report card. He did not take 
				exams that otherwise would have granted him access to higher education such as college or university, but instead took multiple trade courses 
				and worked under his father for three years. 
		</p>
		<h3 class="c"> Personal Relations </h3> 
		<p> 
			Schindler married his wife Emilie Pelzi on March 6, 1928. For a while after his marriage, Schindler quit working for his father and started working 
				a series of odd jobs, such as at a driving school and at the Bank of Prague from 1931 to 1938. Schindler was at a relatively low point in his life, 
				having been arrested a multitude of times for public drunkness from 1931 to 1932, and he also started having an affair with a woman named Aurelie Schlegel 
				whom he met during school. One thing lead to another, and they had a daughter named Emily in 1933 and a son named Oskar Jr in 1935. Not long after, also in 1935, 
				Schindler&apos;s father left his wife who died from illness a few months later. 
		</p> 
		<h2 id = "World_War_II"> World War II </h2>
		<p> 
			In 1935, Schindler joined the Sudeten German Party. The Sudeten German Party was a large pro-Nazi group in Czechoslovakia with the aim of creating division and dispute 
				amongst the country and its people, ultimately joining it with the Third Reich. 					
		</p>
		<p> 
			Schindler&apos;s military and war experience furthered when he became a spy for the Abwehr 
				&lpar;Office of the Military Foreign Intelligence&rpar;. In November of 1938, Schindler applied as a member of the Nazi Party and was accepted in 1939. During his time 
				working for the Abwehr, Schindler was promoted to second in command of his unit, was involved in espionage, and collected information that helped the Nazi party 
				invade Poland. Schindler worked for the Abwehr up until fall of 1940. 
		</p>
		<h3 class="c"> Emalia </h3>
		<p>
			Prior to his leaving of the Abwehr, Schindler arrived in Krak&oacute;w for business related to the Abwehr. There, Schindler rented out an apartment and soon met an interior decorator named Mila Pfefferberg.
				Afterwards, Mila&apos;s son Leopold &ldquo;Poldek&rdquo; Pfefferberg was introduced to Schindler and became Schindler&apos;s gateway to black market trading. Schindler also met a man named Itzhak Stern who was an accountant, 
				and over the years, Stern and Schindler formed an immensely tight bond. Following Germany&apos;s invasion of Poland, Schindler saw an opportunity to buy a previously Jewish owned enamelware factory, namely Rekord Ltd. 
				With enough backing by mainly Jewish investors and bribes sent out to German contacts, he was able to lease the factory, renaming it &ldquo;Deutsche Emailwarenfabrik Oskar Schindler&rdquo; aka &ldquo;Emalia&rdquo;.
		</p>
		<img id="Emalia" src="MiscImages/Emalia.jpg" alt="Entrance to Emalia">
		<p id="Emalia2"> 
			Emalia started production with a small workforce. However, after a mere three months, hundreds of employees were working at Emalia, with seven of whom being Jewish. In 1944, Emalia sheltered nearly 1000 Jewish workers from far worse fates, 
				as they were labelled &ldquo;essential workers&rdquo; protecting them from near&dash;certain death. Although conditions at Emalia were considered good, The Jewish employees at Emalia were still often exposed to the harsh circumstances at
				the Plasz&oacute;w concentration camp. In order to prevent further harm from being done to his workers, with a few bribes and usage of his status, Schindler was able to ensure the safety of the employees, keeping the Jewish workers in Krak&oacute;w
				preventing deportation. While protecting his Jewish workers, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schutzstaffel">Schutzstaffel</a> &lpar;A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramilitary">Paramilitary</a> organization formed under
				Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party during Nazi Germany, becoming one of the most influential and powerful groups in Nazi Germany&rpar; and the police had extreme suspicion as to Schindler&apos;s true motives, claiming corruption 
				and unlawful aid to Jewish people. Schindler was arrested a total of three times, however, there were no charges laid against him as there was not enough convicting evidence. 
		</p>
		<h3 class="e"> Plas&oacute;w </h3>
		<img id="plaszow" src="../Schindler/MiscImages/plaszow2.jpg" alt="An image of Plaszow Concentration Camp">
		<p> 
			During fall of 1941, Nazis started to transport Jews out of the ghetto en masse. Many were sent to their deaths at the <a href="https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/belzec"> Belzec Extermination Camp</a>.
				Roughly the same time next year, a nearby work camp named Plas&oacute;w opened nearby Emalia, and in February of 1943, was under the command of the Schutzstaffel officer Amon G&ouml;th. The Schutzstaffel decided to turn Plasz&oacute;w into a concentration camp in August of 1943.
		</p>
		<p>
			Schindler, understanding that with the newly established concentration camp nearby and the removing of Jews in the ghetto, Schindler sheltered his workers overnight in the factory, protecting them from harm. Schindler witnessed the massacres with his own eyes.
				Those who were considered unable to work were murdered out in the open, and those fit to work were sent off to Plasz&oacute;w never to see their loved ones again. Seeing this himself, Schindler had a revelation about the Nazis, changing his mind entirely about them, 
				making the decision to save as many Jewish lives as humanly possible. 
		</p>
		<p> 
			The man in charge of the concentration camp, Amon G&ouml;th, shot Jews at random via his house balcony, located on top of a hill that was inside the camp itself. G&ouml;th was somebody who was terribly frightening, powerful, and incredibly evil. G&ouml;th had originally wanted to move 
				all factories inside of the camp&apos;s gates, but with Schindler understanding the risk it would pose to his workers, utilized bribes, appeal to human nature and various means to prevent the relocation from happening. Schindler was successful in his efforts, so successful that G&ouml;th allowed
				Schindler to build a subcamp at Emalia, capable of providing shelter for not only his workers but an additional 450 Jews from other nearby factories.

		<h3 class="e"> Br&uuml;nnlitz</h3>
		<img id="Brunnlitz" src="../Schindler/MiscImages/Brunnlitz.jfif" alt="An image of the concentration camp at Brunnlitz">
		<p> In July of 1944, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Army">Workers&apos; and Peasants&apos; Red Army</a> was starting to take over Nazi Germany, starting from the east. In fear of the Red Army disrupting the Nazi Agenda, the Schutzstaffel began closing down concentration camps in the
				east and transported prisoners to either <a href="https://www.auschwitz.org/en/">Auschwitz</a> or <a href="https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/gross-rosen">Gross&dash;Rosen Concentration Camp</a>. Schindler heard from G&ouml;th&apos;s personal secretary and stenographer, 
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mietek_Pemper">Mietek Pemper</a> &lpar;image on the left&rpar;, that the Nazi&apos;s intended to close down all factories that were not contributing to the war effort, which at the time included Schindler&apos;s enamelware factory. It was also Pemper who told Schindler that in place of cookware, Schindler should begin producing anti&dash;tank
				grenades, as that amongst other war products was the only way to keep the Jewish workers safe. Schindler was eventually able to convince G&ouml;th and a multitude of officials in <a href="https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Berlin">Berlin</a> to grant him the ability to transport both his factory and his workers to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brn%C4%9Bnec">Brn&ecaron;nec</a>.
		</p>
		<img id="pemper" src="../Schindler/MiscImages/pemper.jpg" alt="An image of Mietek Pemper">
		<p>
			Marcel Goldberg, a Jewish Ghetto Police, provided names for roughly 1200 Jews, with Pemper typing and compiling them into a list. For every name on that list, Schindler paid a price, in turn trading his wealth for the life of a human being. The Jews and workers on that particular list were the ones who were allowed to be sent to Br&uuml;nnlitz in October of 1944.
		</p>
		<p> 
			On October 15 of 1944, a train with 700 of Schindler's men was sent to the concentration camp at Gross&dash;Rosen, held for roughly one week before being sent to where they were supposed to go, the factory in Br&uuml;nnlitz. Similarly, 300 female Jews were sent to Auschwitz, fearing for their lives as the days went by, not knowing when they would be sent off to die
				in Auschwitz&apos;s infamous gas chambers. The women spent several weeks in Auschwitz before a surplus amount of money, &lpar;Seven reichsmarks per person, roughly &dollar;22.40 CAD&rpar; containing valuables such as goods off of the black market, diamonds, and food were given, granting their release. After their release, the women were all transported off to the factory.
				There, they had to job of making artillery shells that the military could use. Schindler, not wanting to help the Nazi war effort in any way at all, purposefully sabotaged the machines and told his workers to do a poor job at making the shells. Upon a warning from the military stating that the factory was producing insufficient and unsatisfactory shells,
				Schindler began buying shells with his own money off the black market and resold them to the military as if the factory produced them. With the Schutzstaffel not providing enough food for the workers and the artillery shells being bought off the black market, Schindler spent a vast amount of money out of his own pocket in order to maintain the safety of 
				his workers. In yet another act of heroism, Schindler arranged transfers of up to 3000 Jewish women out of Auschwitz to textile plants located in Sudetenland, hoping that it would allow for them to be able to survive the rest of the war.
		</p>
		<p>
			As the war drew to a close, Schindler continued bribing officers of the Schutzstaffel to ensure the safety of his workers. On May 7 of 1945, Schindler, along with his workers met on the factory floor listening to <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/literature/1953/churchill/biographical/">Winston Churchill</a> announce the surrendering of Germany and the ending of the war.
		</p>
		<h2 id="after">After WWII</h2>
		<p>
			After the announcing of Germany&apos;s surrendering, Schindler was given a document, confirming his heroism and role in saving the lives of Jews. He was given a gold ring that was made from smelting a gold filling of the Jewish worker Simon Jeret, inscribed &ldquo;Whoever saves one life saves the world entire.&rdquo; Schindler fled to a multitude of destinations, ultimately moving to Munich. 
				Despite being wealthy during the war, his selfless expenditures used up the large majority of his money, leaving him broke. Schindler could not find success in business after the war.
				Schindler had a continuous amount of failed work prospects that included owning livestock and owning a cement factory. 
		</p>
		<p>
			In 1963, Schindler declared bankruptcy and the next year, had a heart attack. Schindler survived on donations sent by those he saved.
		</p>
		<p> 
			Schindler died of liver failure on October 9, 1974, and is buried in Jerusalem on Mount Zion. At the age of 66, Schindler died a hero.
